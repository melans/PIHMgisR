The Penn State Integrated Hydrologic Model (PIHM) is a multiprocess, multi-scale hydrologic model where the major hydrological processes are fully coupled using the semi-discrete finite volume method. 
  
This tool kit is to convert the geospatial data into PIHM format. 

The version of PIHMgisR are only works for latest PIHM v3.0, that was developed in C++.
